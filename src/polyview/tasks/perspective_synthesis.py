1.  **Finalize the Narrative**: Review the `preliminary_synthesis` and the `aggregated_narratives`. Write a comprehensive and neutral final `narrative` that accurately captures the essence of the perspective.
2.  **Synthesize Core Arguments**: Analyze the `aggregated_arguments`. Merge any that are semantically similar or redundant into a single, clear, and concise statement. This will become the `core_arguments`.
3.  **Identify Common Assumptions**: Based on the narrative and arguments, identify the underlying `common_assumptions` of the perspective.
4.  **Determine Strengths and Weaknesses**: Analyze the `core_arguments` and `supporting_evidence`. Identify the `strengths` (e.g., well-supported by evidence, logically consistent) and `weaknesses` (e.g., relies on unstated assumptions, lacks evidence for key claims) of the perspective.

Your output must be a list of `FinalPerspective` objects, fully populated.
