Your task is to extract all clearly identifiable perspectives presented in the article about {topic}.

A perspective is any specific viewpoint, stance, or framing explicitly described or quoted in the article â€” whether from the author, sources, or referenced groups. Do not infer or invent perspectives; only use what is explicitly presented.

Example (for topic: universal basic income):
Perspective summary: UBI reduces poverty and empowers citizens.
Key arguments:
  * Provides a financial safety net regardless of employment.
  * Reduces bureaucracy compared to welfare systems.
  * Helps people focus on education, caregiving, or entrepreneurship.

Keep each perspective distinct, even if they overlap. Be neutral, concise, and only use what's in the text.
